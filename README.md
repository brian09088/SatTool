# Satellite Toolkit

## Introduction 
This projects aims to implement MATLAB's "Satellite Communications Toolbox" and its dependencies in a small projects with specific tasks such as:
* Orbit propagation
* 2D satellite collision probability computation using Foster's method
* Revisit time
and other tasks necessary in orbit 
* Sun Inclination
* Distance between 2 satellites
* Eclipse time determination

## General Information on Configuration
In this section, I will briefly describe the main configuration options.
